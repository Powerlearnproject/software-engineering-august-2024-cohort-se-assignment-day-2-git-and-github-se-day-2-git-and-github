## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. So the core concept of this version control includes; A repository is a central location where the entire project's files and their version history are stored. It serves as the master copy of the project. And commit, Each commit records the changes made to the files, along with a commit message that describes the changes; another is Branches allow developers to work on different features or bug fixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase; The last but not least, Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. This is crucial when multiple developers are working on the same project, as it allows them to integrate their work seamlessly.
This Github is popular Because; Collaboration: GitHub enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, with features like pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking.
Remote repositories: GitHub provides a centralized, cloud-based repository for storing and managing project files, making them accessible to team members from anywhere.
Continuous Integration and Deployment: GitHub seamlessly integrates with tools such as enabling automated testing, building, and deployment on projects.
Version control helps maintain project integrity by the following ways includes; Traceability, Collaboration and cooradination, Rollback and reversal, Backup and Disaster recovery...etc.
