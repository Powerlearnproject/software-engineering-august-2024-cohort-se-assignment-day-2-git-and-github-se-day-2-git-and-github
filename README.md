## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
 version control system keeps detailed record of every modification made to the code,ensuring that this changes are both trackable and reversable.
**Why GitHub is the most popular vversion control** 
* Adaptability
* Speed 
* Stability required to thrive in fast-paced markets
* Open source community.
**How version control Maintains Project intergrity**
* Maintaining a comprehensive revision history.
* Tracking modification.
* Reverting to previous versions.
* Back up.
