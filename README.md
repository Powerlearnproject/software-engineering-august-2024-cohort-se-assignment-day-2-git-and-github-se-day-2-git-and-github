## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?

Fundamental concepts of version control
o	A repository
It is a storage place for all versions of a project’s files, including their history. Each project usually has its repo. 
A repo keeps track of all files and changes, letting you see past versions and changes. 

o	Pull Request
When you make changes in your branch, you use a pull request to ask others to review and merge the changes. It’s also known as a merge request.

o	Commit
 Groups change into snapshots of the project at specific times. 
Each commit has a unique ID and a message about the changes. 
Commit stores who made the changes and include a description. 

o	Branch
It is a separate line of development. It lets you work on different features or fixes at the same time without affecting the main project. 
You can later merge these changes back into the main branch. 
Branches can be named for easier tracking, and the main branch where final changes are merged is often called "master" or "trunk." 

o	Merging 
Combines changes from different branches or versions. 
When you're ready to share your branch, merge it with the main branch. Version control systems help automate this process, handling most merges smoothly. 

o	Conflict
It occurs when multiple developers make edits to a code at the same time, and their changes sometimes conflict.

o	Checkout
When a file is retrieved from a version control system.

o	Tag
A marker used by developers to label a specific point in the source code history. 
They can also be used to show before changes are made to codebase.

o	Remote repositories 
They are stored on servers, like GitHub, and help with collaboration and backup. 
To share your changes with others, you need to push your commits to the remote repository. 

o	Fork
Creates a personal copy of a project from someone else’s repository.

o	Revert
A developer can undo any changes made.

Why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code
o	Helps to document requirements. You can either document bugs or share new features.

o	Collaborate on independent streams of history. Using branches and pull requests, you can collaborate on different branches or features.

o	Review work in progress.

o	You can see team progress. 

o	Provides a secure access.

How version control helps maintain project integrity
o	Track changes
You can view when changes were made, who made the changes, and why they made the changes. 

o	Revert changes
Changes made can be undone.

o	Branch and merge
Working on separate branches helps developers experiment and develop new features. 
After they are done they merge into the default main branch to integrate the changes. 

o	History and accountability
Changes are recorded in commit messages. This creates a historical record of the development process. 


## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?

Process of setting up a new repository on GitHub
o	Login to your GitHub account

o	On the left side of the account click on the tab New to create a new repository

o	Type in a repository name. The repository name should be short and memorable.

o	You can describe the repository. This is optional. 

o	You can make your repository either public or private. 

o	In a public repository, anyone on the internet can see this repository. You choose who can commit to it. In a private repository, you choose who can see and commit to this repository. 

o	You will initialize this repository by adding a README file.

o	A README file gives a long description of your project. 

o	Add the gitignore. You can create a gitignore file in your repository to tell Git which files and directories to ignore when you make a commit.

o	Choose a license for your repository. A license tells others what they can and can’t do with your code. 

o	This repository you create will be the main default branch.

o	Click on the Create Repository icon at the bottom to finish the process. 


## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?

Importance of the README file 
o	A README file tells other people why your project is useful.
o	A README file tells other people what they can do with your project.
o	A README file tells other people how they can use the project.

What should be included in a README file
o	What the project does
o	Why the project is useful
o	How users can get started with the project
o	Where users can get help with the project
o	Who maintains and contributes to the project

How does README file contribute to effective collaboration? 
o	It explains what a project is about. 
o	It has instructions and contact info.
o	Gives details such as how to install, use, and contribute to a project.
o	Makes it easier for others to understand the project.
o	Prevents confusion.


## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?

Differences between public and private repository
o	A public repository anyone on the internet can see the repository. You choose who can commit to it.

o	A private repository you choose who can see and commit to the repository. 

Advantages of private repositories
o	It limits distractions from other contributors.
o	It has controlled access.
o	It keeps your code and project details confidential.
o	Reduces risk of tampering or unauthorized access.
o	You decide who can make changes to your project. 

Disadvantage of private repositories
o	No public exposure
o	It might require a paid package and thus become costly.
o	Less visibility.
o	Limited collaboration
o	Access and permissions are managed manually. 

Advantages of public repositories
o	You get a big community of users and contributors.
o	It can help you build a reputation and get recognition.
o	It is an opportunity for others to learn.
o	Promotes collaboration
o	Everyone can see and access your code and project.

Disadvantage of public repositories
o	Competitors can view your code and projects.
o	There are security risks.
o	A lack of privacy.
o	Intellectual property. It can lead to issues of ownership.
o	It can attract unwanted comments and contributions. 


## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?

What is a commit? 
o	A commit records changes to one or more files. 

How does commit help track changes, and manage different versions of the project?
o	Git assigns each commit a unique ID that identifies: -
-	Specific changes made
-	When the changes were made
-	The person who created the changes
  
o	When a commit is made a message must be included to describe the changes that were made.

Steps on how to make your first commit.
o	Create a repository on GitHub. This is done by clicking ‘New’ on the left side. Follow the instructions to create the new repository. 

o	Clone the repository. On your project’s overview page, right side, click ‘Clone’.

o	Open a terminal on the computer and go to the directory where you want to clone the files. (cd path)

o	Type ‘git clone’ and paste the URL copied from the clone.

o	Go to the directory. (cd my-project)

o	Create a branch where you will make your changes. (this is the default branch: - git branch) (The branch you’re on is marked with an asterisk. Press Q on your keyboard to return to the main terminal window.) (creating the branch: - git checkout –b name of the branch)

o	In a text editor like Visual Studio Code, open the README.md file and make the necessary changes. Save the file. 

o	To confirm which files have changed, get the status. (git status)

o	Add the README.md file to the staging area. (The staging area is where you put files before you commit them.) (git add README.md)

o	Confirm the file is staged. (git status)

o	Commit the staged file, and include a message that describes the change you made. Make sure you surround the message in double quotes (“). (git commit –m “type message”)

o	The change has been committed to your branch available only on your computer. No one else has access to them yet. 

o	Push your branch to GitHub. (git push origin name of your branch)

o	The branch is now available on GitHub and visible to other users. 

o	Create a merge request for the push. (merge_request.create)

o	Merge changes to the default main branch. (git checkout main) (to merge: - git merge <name of your branch>)


## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

How does branching work?
o	A branch is a copy of the files in a repository. 
o	A branch is created from an existing default branch. 
o	It allows you to safely experiment in a contained area of your repository.

Why is branching an important feature in collaborative development
o	You can work on your branch without affecting other people.
o	We use branches when we want to add code to a project.
o	We use branches when we are collaborating with others in a project and we don’t want our work mixed up. 

Process of creating, using, and merging branches.
o	Open a terminal.
o	Choose the directory where your project is. (cd <my_project>)
o	Create a new branch on git. (git branch <branch_name>)
o	Creating a new branch from an existing branch on git. (git checkout –b <new_branch_name>)
o	Switch to the new branch name. (git checkout <branch_name)
o	Copy the file you want to add to the directory.
o	Check the status of the file. The file name should be in red. (git status)
o	Track the file. (git add <file name>)
o	Check status. The file name should be in green. (git status)
o	Make necessary changes. (git add .)
o	Commit changes. (git commit –m  “<message>”)
o	Push the changes to the remote repository. (git push <remote_url> <name_of_branch)
o	Create a merge request for the push. (merge_request.create)
o	Merge changes to the default main branch. (git checkout main) (to merge: - git merge <name of your branch>)


## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

Role of Pull Requests
o	It proposes and suggests updates from your branch to the main project.
o	Helps track changes made.
o	Changes are merged once they are approved.
o	Team members review the changes.
o	The pull request can either be approved or denied. 

How do pull requests facilitate code review and collaboration?
o	The code is reviewed.
o	Suggestions are made.
o	Discussion about the changes arises.
o	Changes are either approved or denied.
o	A record of changes is made. 

Process of creating and merging a pull request
o	Go to the main page of the repository.
o	Under the name of the repository click on ‘Pull requests’.
o	In the ‘Pull Request’, click the request you would like to merge. 
o	At the bottom of the pull request click on ‘Merge Pull Request’.
o	When ready, type a commit message, or accept the default message.
o	Click on Confirm merge.


## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?

Forking a repository
o	Go to the repository you want to fork on GitHub and click the ‘Fork’ button at the top right. 
o	On the icon ‘Owner’, select the owner for the forked repository.
o	Forks are named the same as the upstream repository.
o	You can do a description of the repository. This is optional. 
o	You can select ‘Copy the Default branch’. This is optional. If you don’t select this option, all the branches will be copied into the new fork. 
o	Click ‘Create Fork’.

How does forking differ from cloning
o	Cloning is the process of downloading a copy of a project from GitHub into your local machine.

Where would forking be helpful
o	Where you don’t have the necessary permission to make changes directly to a project. 
o	Where it’s an open-source project written by people you don’t know. 
o	A project is written by another group at your company that you don’t interact with much and you want to propose changes.
o	Use another person’s project as a starting point for your project.


## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

Importance of issues and project boards
o	Issues help track tasks, bugs, and improvements. 
o	Issues describe problems or new features and assign them to team members.
o	Project boards organize and plan work using boards and cards.
o	Project boards show tasks in columns such as ‘to do’, ‘in progress’, and ‘done’.
o	Both help track progress.
o	Both facilitate communication and coordination among team members.

How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve projects?
o	Track bugs
Open an issue to report a problem. E.g. ‘Button A on page Y is not working’.

o	Manage tasks.
Create issues for tasks to be done. E.g. ‘‘Assign issue #35 – fixing a code error to Janet.’

o	Request features
Use issues to suggest new features. E.g. ‘add a search bar to homepage’.

o	Discuss solutions to issues.

o	Organize tasks
Set up project board columns e.g. ‘In progress
Move issues between columns as work progresses.

o	Prioritize work
Set priorities on issues to be dealt with first. E.g. Move “Critical security patch” to the top of the “To Do” list.
Urgent tasks should be at the top.

o	Visualize the workflow
All tasks and statuses should be on the project board.

o	Track progress
Use milestones to group related issues. E.g. ‘Add profile page” from “To Do” to “In Progress”.’


## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?

Challenges of using GitHub
o	Hidden bugs in code causing significant issues, impacting the project timelines and budget.
o	Reviewing and merging lengthy pull requests.
o	Limited security in the public repositories.
o	Costly for private repositories.
o	Poor support for beginners.
o	The features and interface can be hard for beginners.
o	Suggested codes can be inaccurate.
o	Advanced features are only present in paid plans.
o	Unintended changes to the main branch can disrupt project flow.

Best Practices associated with GitHub
o	Align package versions
Reusing code and tests can be hard if the same package has different versions across projects. Even if everyone on your team uses the same package, different versions make reuse difficult. Use the same version of the package in all projects.

o	Lock package version
The manifest file lists all package versions and dependencies for your project. To avoid issues, always specify a version or range for each package. 
Using a manifest lock file is a good practice as it ensures the same package versions are installed every time. Without it, you risk getting different versions on each build, which can break your code.

o	Preserve inactive repositories
Over time, we end up with unmaintained repositories. These might have been created for temporary uses or contain outdated code. 
Archive unused repositories. Make them "read-only" so they can’t be changed or mistakenly used.

o	Create meaningful git ignore file
A .gitignore file is essential for each repository to exclude certain files and directories. 
It helps protect secret keys and avoid including unnecessary dependencies or errors. You can use a template from Gitignore.io to set it up quickly.

o	Avoid including configuration files in the source code.
Do not commit your local config files to version control. 
These files often contain secrets, personal settings, or other private information that should remain only on your local machine.

o	Avoid including dependencies in the source code.
Including dependencies in your remote repository will make it larger. Instead, remove these dependencies and let your package manager handle them during builds. 
If you’re concerned about dependency availability, use a binary repository manager like Jfrog or Nexus Repository, or check out GitHub’s Git-Sizer.

o	Don’t let secrets leak into source code
Secrets like passwords, API keys, and SSH keys should never be committed into your source code. 
Instead, use environment variables and secure stores like Hashicorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager to manage them. 
Tools such as Git-secrets can help find passwords in your code, and Git Hooks can create pre-commit checks to prevent secrets from being added.

o	Define code owners for each repository
When managing many repositories and engineers, it’s hard to know who owns different parts of the code and needs to review changes. 
Use the Code Owners feature to automatically assign reviewers based on who is responsible for each part of the repository.

o	Do git commit with the right email

o	Don’t just git commit directly to the master.
